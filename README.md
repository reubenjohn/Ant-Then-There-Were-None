# Ant Then There Were None
Simulating an ant colony.

Why?
---
Because Ants are cool! Don't believe me? Check out this video by Ted-Ed.

On a more serious note, Ant colonies represent a very important problem in Artificial Intelligence. Ant colonies are perfect examples of [Swarm Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence). Ant colonies are capable of highly complex and coordinated behaviors from otherwise simple rules a.k.a emergent behaviors.

How?
---
In order to truly demonstrate emergent behaviors, the only behaviors that are explicitly encoded are for that of an individual ant. Any macro behaviors of the colony, as a result, are therefore most certainly emergent.

- ~~Roam~~
- ~~Grab food in sensory range~~
- ~~Attraction towards food markers (presumably left by other ants)~~
- Drop food markers
- Drop at queen in sensory range
- Attraction towards queen markers when food is in posession
